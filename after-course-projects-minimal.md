File Directory - Provide an admin user with the ability to upload files for the public. Like PDFs, Word Docs, whatever. Can be simple or advanced. (Comparable but more useful IMO than FreeCodeCamp's File Metadata Microservice : https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/file-metadata-microservice)

Kiosk Management System

MyTop100Movies - API,Database,CRUD - Application which lets users set their top 100 movies. Movies could come from an API like The Movie Database (http://tmdb.org). Should allow for users to add a movie, list and rank their movie selections. Start with basic CRUD for movies and add features.

ScheduleMaker - This one's harder. Can develop the database schema or an application. Let one user define the schedule for others. Or let users select their own schedule.

Personnel or Business Directory - Create database model/backend for a company directory.
